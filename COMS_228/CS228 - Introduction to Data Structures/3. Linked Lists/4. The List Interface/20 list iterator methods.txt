List Iterator Method 	Returns
---------------------------------------------------------- 

int nextIndex()		index of element after the cursor; 
			size() if at the end 
int previousIndex()	index of element before the cursor; 
			-1 if at the beginning

boolean hasNext()	nextIndex() < size 
boolean hasPrevious()	previousIndex() > 0

E next()		returns element after the cursor 
			and moves cursor forward 
E previous()		returns element before the cursor,
			and moves cursor backward


void remove()		removes the last element returned by next()
			or previous()

			can only be called once after next() or 
			previous(), and ListIterator.add() has not
 			been called in between.  

void add(E item)	insert immediately before the element that
			would be returned by next(), and after the 
			element that would be returned by previous()

void set(E item)  	replace the last element returned by next()
			or previous(). 

			can be called only if neither remove()
			nor add() has been called after the last 
			call to next() or previous()
